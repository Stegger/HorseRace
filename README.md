# HorseRace

It's a game about horce races. Multiple players can bet on horses that have somewhat random behaviour. The game is a consultative solution to a computer science exercise for danish computer science students at Business Academy Southwest in Esbjerg, Denmark. 

The exercise is an early exercise that is introduced before the students have learned about arrays and lists. Thus the solution I present here is also without any lists/arrays.
